# Core Python + Data structures and Algorithms.

breakdown of the **precise topics** we will focus on:

---

## ✅ 1. **Python I/O and File Handling**

You must be comfortable with:

* Reading from a file line-by-line
* Reading from standard input (`stdin`)
* Using `with open(...)` safely

📚 **Key concepts:**

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
```

---

## ✅ 2. **String Manipulation**

You need to:

* Split strings
* Strip whitespace
* Convert string to int

📚 **Key methods:**

* `.split()`
* `.strip()`
* `.rsplit(maxsplit=1)` — for splitting from the right once

---

## ✅ 3. **Error Handling**

Robust code requires:

* Handling `ValueError` when converting strings to integers
* Catching file-not-found or general exceptions

📚 **Learn:**

```python
try:
    value = int("123")
except ValueError:
    print("Not a valid integer")
```

---

## ✅ 4. **Data Structures**

This is the core of your question.

### ✅ a. **Lists**

* How to create and use lists
* Append and sort elements

### ✅ b. **Tuples**

* `(value, url)` pairs
* Sorting tuples

### ✅ c. **Heaps (Priority Queues)**

* Use `heapq` module to manage top-N elements efficiently
* Know how to:

  * Use `heappush()`
  * Use `heappushpop()`
  * Maintain a **min-heap** of fixed size

📚 You need to understand:

```python
import heapq

heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, (value, url))
```

---

## ✅ 5. **Sorting and Lambda Functions**

Understand how to:

* Sort tuples
* Use `sorted()` with a custom key (if needed)
* Understand the difference between ascending vs descending sorting

📚 Example:

```python
sorted(my_list, reverse=True)
```

---

## ✅ 6. **Basic Algorithms**

While not advanced, you need to know:

* **Top-K problem** → This problem is a variation of that
* Efficient use of **heap for partial sorting**

---

## ✅ 7. **Command-Line and `stdin` Handling**

You must know how to:

* Read file paths from the command line
* Read user input with `input()` or `sys.stdin.readline()`

## 🧠 Summary: Topics to Learn in Python

| Category                 | Topics                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Core Python**          | File I/O, `input()`, `with open`, `try/except`, string operations  |
| **Data Structures**      | Lists, Tuples, Heaps (`heapq`), sorting tuples                     |
| **Algorithms**           | Top-K problems, streaming data handling                            |
| **Python Libraries**     | `heapq`, `sys`                                                     |
| **Extra (Nice to Have)** | Testing with `unittest`, writing a `Makefile`, understanding Big-O |

## 🔁 Optional Learning Path (For This Task)

1. ✅ Master `with open(...)` and `readline()`
2. ✅ Practice splitting lines and parsing ints safely
3. ✅ Learn how to use `heapq` to solve top-N problems
4. ✅ Try small scripts using command-line input
5. ✅ Build a project that reads a large file and filters data
