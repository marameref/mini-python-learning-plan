Awesome! Here’s your **Python learning plan** tailored specifically to help you master everything needed to solve the **top-10 URLs problem** (or similar data processing tasks) confidently.

# 🧑‍🏫 **Mini Python Learning Plan: From Basics to Top-K Problem Solver**

### 📦 Goal:

Learn and practice just enough **Python, data structures, file handling, and algorithms** to confidently solve the "Top 10 URLs" challenge and similar backend processing problems.

---

## 📅 Week 1: Core Python Essentials

### ✅ Topics:

* Python variables & data types
* Lists and tuples
* String methods (`split`, `strip`)
* Reading input and writing output

### 🧠 Practice Exercises:

1. Write a script that reads a name from input and prints `Hello, <name>`.
2. Parse this string and print each part:

   ```python
   "http://example.com/item 50"
   ```
3. Split and extract only the number:

   ```python
   line = "https://api.com/resource/1 45"
   ```

---

## 📅 Week 2: File I/O and Error Handling

### ✅ Topics:

* `with open(...) as f`
* Reading files line by line
* Handling exceptions with `try/except`

### 🧠 Practice Exercises:

1. Create a file with 5 lines like:

   ```
   http://site.com/page 10
   ```

   Write a script that reads and prints each line.

2. Modify it to skip malformed lines (e.g., missing number).

3. Try reading a file that doesn’t exist and handle `FileNotFoundError`.

---

## 📅 Week 3: Data Structures for Backend Tasks

### ✅ Topics:

* Lists and list operations
* Tuples and tuple sorting
* Sorting with `key` and `lambda`
* `heapq` module for min-heap

### 🧠 Practice Exercises:

1. Sort this list by second element:

   ```python
   items = [(50, "a.com"), (30, "b.com"), (90, "c.com")]
   ```

2. Push and pop from a min-heap using `heapq`.

3. Keep only the 3 biggest values from a stream of numbers using a min-heap.

---

## 📅 Week 4: Algorithms and Final Project

### ✅ Topics:

* Top-K Problem using a heap
* Reading very large files efficiently
* Putting everything together
* Writing clean, testable code

### 🧠 Project:

Build the **Top 10 URLs script**:

1. Accept file path from `stdin`.
2. Read the file line by line.
3. For each line, split into `(url, value)`.
4. Add to a min-heap of size 10.
5. At the end, print the top 10 URLs.

---

## 🚀 Bonus: Engineer Mindset

* Write clean functions (`process_file()`)
* Handle edge cases
* Use `Makefile` or shell scripts to automate
* Add a small test file with sample data

## 📦 Deliverables by the End:

* ✅ Understand reading and parsing lines from files
* ✅ Use `heapq` to manage top-N values
* ✅ Handle errors and edge cases
* ✅ Build and test a small but production-style script
